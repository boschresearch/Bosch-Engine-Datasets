# Datasets
## gengine1 and gengine2
We provide two datasets _gengine1_ and _gengine2_.
Each dataset consists of _N_ measurements of the gasoline engine
D = {d<sub>1</sub>,...,d<sub>N</sub>}. Each measurement d = {(u<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>),...,(u<sub>T</sub>, y<sub>T</sub>)} contains a trajectory
of length _T_ where the inputs are denoted as
u<sub>t</sub> and the outputs as y<sub>t</sub>.
The length of the trajectory may vary between measurements.
The data points are recorded every _10 Hz_.
Each measurement is saved as a separate csv-file.
The data is standardized to mean-zero and unit-variance on the training data set.

### gengine1
The dataset _gengine1_ contains in total _33_ measurements.
We used the measurements _[10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39]_
for training and the measurements _[53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65]_ for
testing.

The first 5 columns correspond to the inputs u<sub>t</sub>:

- Speed
- Load
- Lambda
- Ignition Angle
- Fuel Cutoff

The last 8 columns correspond to the outputs y<sub>t</sub>:

- Particle Numbers
- CO
- CO2
- HC
- Nox
- O2
- Temperatue (Exhaus Manifold)
- Temperate (Catalyst 1)

### gengine 2
The dataset _gengine2_ contains in total _22_ measurements.
We used the measurements _[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]_
for training and the measurements _[16,17,18,19,20,21]_ for
testing.

The first 4 columns correspond to the inputs u<sub>t</sub>:

- Speed
- Load
- Lambda
- Ignition Angle

The last 5 columns correspond to the outputs y<sub>t</sub>:

- Particle Numbers
- HC
- Nox
- Temperatue (Exhaus Manifold)
- Temperature (Catalyst 1)


## pengines
In the folder _./pengines_, we provide two datasets _pengines/engine1.xlsx_ and _pengines/engine2.xlsx_.
These two files are measurements of the same system under different conditions.
Each dataset consists of _N_ measurements of data pair (**x**<sub>n</sub>, **y**<sub>n</sub>).
Each column is standardized to zero-mean and unit-variance.
Each file contains an additional sheet providing quantiles of the standardized data.
Additionally, the operating an engine usually has safety concern.
We thus provided suggested safety values (_engines_transfer_learning_problem/safety_constraint.xlsx_).

In these files, the first 4 columns correspond to the inputs **x**<sub>n</sub>:

- engine_speed
- engine_load
- intake_valve_opening
- air_fuel_ratio

The last 7 columns correspond to the outputs **y**<sub>n</sub>:

- specific_fuel_consumption
- temperature_exhaust_manifold
- temperature_in_catalyst
- engine_roughness_v (variance of indicated cylinder pressure)
- engine_roughness_s (standard deviation of indicated cylinder pressure, we mainly use this one)
- HC
- NOx
